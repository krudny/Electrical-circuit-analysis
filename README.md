# Electrical Circuit Analysis

## Overview, key features

Given number of vertices, electromotive force and maximum resistance, algorithm: 

- generates random graph
- finds approximate direction of current flow (BFS)
- detects all simple cycles in undirected graph
- finds equations according to Kirchhoff laws 
- calculates current on every edge
- adds adjustments to find real direction of current flow
- generates and displays network graph 

## Technologies used

- Python 
- Calculations: Numpy
- Displaying graphs: Pyvis.network
- Development environment: Pycharm Professional
